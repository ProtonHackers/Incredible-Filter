# Incredible-Filter
Made by Vikranth Srivatsa, Rohan Koodli, Aubhro Sengupta, and Vineet Mudupalli in 24 hours at HSHacks III.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the recent spread of false news and we also wanted to create a hack against cyberbullying.

## What it does
Incredible Filter gets rid of any false news and alerts you if you try to tweet a false news story. Also, any hateful tweets are hidden from view. This helps normal people distinguish between what is real and what is fake

## How we built it
We used IBM Bluemix and scikit-learn to write our machine learning backend to classify news articles as fake and to classify tweets as hateful. We used Firebase to store tweet info, and we accessed this through the iOS frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to do the machine learning on the news articles, getting Firebase to work with Python 3, and linking the iOS frontend to our backend server.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We wrote a machine learning SVM with scikit-learn and Bluemix.

## What we learned
We learned an easier way to use IBM APIs as well as how to use the IBM Tone Classifier.

## What's next for Incredible Feed
A stronger machine learning backend.
